# gratitudeJournalApp
A real world adaptation of writing daily journal.

Inspired by [this article](https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/giving-thanks-can-make-you-happier) from Harvard Medical School, this user-friendly app aims to let users write gratitudes on a daily basis. Gratitude is something you're grateful for whether it be personal, work-related or something else. Studies have shown that individuals who took time to express gratitude feel more positive and motivated.
