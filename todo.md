A user should be able to create gratitude and submit it. Examples would be "watching a movie when I've finished all my chores", or "the first coffee on a Saturday morning".
The user can see all previous gratitudes they've entered.
Gratitudes should be limited to 140 characters.
The app should support multiple users. They can only see their own gratitudes.
The user should be able to register, login, request a forgotten password email. The forgotten password email will link the user to a page to reset their password. Finally, the user should receive an email when the password has been updated.
There should be a feature that a user can opt into that sends them an email every day listing random gratitude they've previously added, like, "On {{this date}}, you were grateful for {{gratitude}}".
This feature can only be selected when they have added more than 10 gratitudes.
There should be a personal feed of the user listing all gratitudes.
